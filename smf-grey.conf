# DNSBL settings
# 
# Extends the grey time based on whether the connecting MTA is in the given
# DNSBLs. Reduces the grey time (perhaps eliminating it) if the MTA is in a
# whitelist.
# Warning: Some of the DNSBL services below may have usage limits or
# conditions, please check with their respective information pages before
# activating. Many RBLs are available, see http://www.robtex.com/rbls.html
# for a useful test and listing tool.

# Greylist/Autowhitelist time settings
#
# The time is given in seconds, except if a unit is given:
# m for minutes, h for hours, and d for days
#
# Defaults:
#
# How much time is required before accepting the delayed e-Mail message
#GreyTime	5m

# If the extended GreyTime is greater than BlockTime, reject the message
# This is checked before MaxGreyTime is applied.
#BlockTime 12h

# Cap on GreyTime after extension by DNSBLs
#MaxGreyTime 10h

# How long to remember greylist tuples. If a server attempts to retransmit
# a message more than this time after the initial attempt then it will
# never succeed.
#GreyTimeout	12h

# How long an autowhitelist is going on. This is auto prolonged when another
# message is sent.
#GreyWhitelist	7d

# How many messages (with different sender & recipient) do we accept
# from a /24 network before we allow messages through automatically
# Only messages accepted more than AutoWhiteDelay apart will be included.
#AutoWhiteList 5

# What is the minimum delay between messages to be considered for
# auto whitelisting a /24 network
#AutoWhiteDelay 1h

# How many messages tuples can a /24 network have pending before we 
# defer them automatically (without greylisting). This should be set
# higher for larger volume sites to avoid excess delays on high volume
# sites (before the auto subnet whitelist kicks in, which will take
# at lease AutoWhiteList * AutoWhiteDelay - default 5 hours).
# This parameter also conserves memory by only allowing a particular
# remote server to have this many records in our database.
#AutoBlockList 5

# Increase the AutoBlockList limit by the number of messages already accepted
# for the network times this multiplier.
#AutoBlockMultiplier 2

# How many slots should be kept open for real message delivery attempts?
# This parameter attempts to prevent sender address verificiation from
# DOS'ing a remote MTA by deferring the tempfail until after the DATA
# has been received when there are AutoBlockGuard or less slots before
# the auto block kicks in.
#AutoBlockGuard 3

# How often to export the cache. These exports only output new or changed
# records. There is an additional daily rewrite of the entire cache which
# cleans out any expired or unnecessary records.
# or set to 0 to enable "realtime" flock() grained syncing (cluster)
# old default - 2m, new - 0
#CacheWriteInterval 0

# 1 - Do flush() & flock(LOCK_UN) before fclose(); 0 - simple fclose()
# 1 - may be more friendly (or not) for distributed filesystem;
# 0 - minimize syscalls
#DoFlush 1

# More than DNSBLMaxFail failures within this period will disable that
# DNSBL for the rest of the period.
#DNSBLFailTime 1h

# How many failures can we see on a DNSBL before we stop using it for the
# rest of the DNSBLFailTime period.
#DNSBLMaxFail 6
